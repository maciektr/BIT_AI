# BIT AI 2019 2020 lectures notebooks

Github repository for everyone who wants to learn **Machine Learning**!

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks and presentations presented during the meetings of the AI section of Bit Scientific Group @ Cracow University of Science and Technology, where we dive deep into Machine Learning awesomeness.

The notebooks are intended to compose an introductory Machine Learning course, tackling topics ranging from linear regression to various forms of Deep Learning. Their aim is to introduce the reader to the math and techniques behind ML, as well as the most popular programming tools designed with ML in mind, such as Scikit-Learn and PyTorch.
